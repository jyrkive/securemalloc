* change the physical page allocator to use anonymous files as the backing store, see
  https://manned.org/memfd_create.2
* when malloc() and friends are called with an allocation of 4 kB or less, grab a page
  from the virtual page allocator, alias it with the page storing the real underlying
  allocation using the technique described in https://stackoverflow.com/a/67781757 and
  return the address in the virtual page instead of the original page
* consider removing said alias when free() is called (and when realloc() needs to
  switch to a different physical page)
